## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

### What I learned

I've started learning how to create a repository on GitHub, which is no mean feat for a beginner. I'm still trying to figure out how to manage the confidentiality of different directories to control the accessibility of my folders.

### Continued development

I feel quite comfortable learning css and html and their subtleties but I feel more uncomfortable with javascript and I think I should concentrate more on this language to improve my performance.
